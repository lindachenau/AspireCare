##WE REMAIN OPEN FOR YOU

For public health and to provide a safe environment for all, adults and children over 12 are required to wear a face mask while visiting the clinic for face to face consultations.

We will continue to offer Medicare Bulk-Billed Telehealth including Phone & Video Consultations for ALL our patients. Please select the “telehealth” option when booking online or call us on 9805 2803 to make a booking.

In accordance with NSW Health Guidelines, we ask any individuals who have Flu like symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose or shortness of breath), recent travel or suspected contact, to please stay at home and organise a phone consultation with one of our doctors.

We understand the stress and anxiety during this difficult time. Please call the practice and we will try to accommodate any special needs.
