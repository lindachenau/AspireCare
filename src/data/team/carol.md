Kai is a family GP who is devoted to provide holistic care for his patients. His rural GP training experience equipped him with outstanding skills for handling emergency cases. He is accredited to perform surgical procedures for cryotherapy and minor skin lesions.    

He is a great listener and goes beyond to solve complex medical cases. He always has a smile on his face. His patients told him that they feel much better already as soon as they walk into his consulting room.    

In his free time, he enjoys being a handyman for his household. His collection of tools almost can compete with tradesmen.
