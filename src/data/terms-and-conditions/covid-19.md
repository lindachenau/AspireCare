Only patients who are eligible under the current phase will be able to receive the vaccine.

If you are unwell with flu-like symptoms or if you are pregnant, you will not be able to receive the vaccine at this stage.

You will need to check in using a QR code which will be posted at the clinic reception. If you cannot use a QR code to check in, let the receptionist know - alternatives are available but are slower.

Only your first dose can be booked online. Your second dose can be booked while at the clinic.
