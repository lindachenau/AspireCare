Our practice policy:
- We do not provide prescriptions for opiate analgesics or benzodiazepines.
- We cannot issue backdated medical certificates.

Our appointments are in high demand. In order to serve people with more urgent medical concerns effectively, we have to enforce a strict booking rule. If you cannot attend your appointment, please cancel your booking 2 hours beforehand. A $20 penalty applies for failing to do so 3 times.

During Covid-19 pandemic, if you have a sore throat, temperature, running nose or coughing and have visited our practice in the past 12 months, please only book a telehealth consultation.
