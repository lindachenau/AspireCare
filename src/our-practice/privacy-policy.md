We are committed to protecting your privacy, and ensuring that the ways in which we deal with your personal information comply with the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/" title="Privacy Act">
Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</a> (‘Privacy Act’) and any other applicable health records legislation.

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically and without notice to you. You should review this Privacy Policy from time to time to review any changes. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us using our contact details contained in Contacting Us below.

### Collection
To provide our services and run our business, we need to collect personal information, being information or an opinion about an individual which is reasonably capable of identifying that individual(and which might also include their health or other sensitive information) (‘***Patient Information***’).

We (on behalf of) and the practitioners may collect ***Patient Information*** regarding patients for the purpose of providing medical services and treatment to patients. ***Patient Information*** collected will generally include:

- the patient’s name, date of birth, sex, ethnic origin, address, telephone number, email and Medicare details/health fund; 
- current drugs or treatments used by the patient; 
- previous and current medical history, including where clinically relevant a family medical history, and the name of any health service provider or medical specialist to whom the patient is referred, copies of any letters of referrals and copies of any reports back or other information which falls within the scope of ‘health information’ as that term is defined in the Privacy Act; 
- your online booking history on our website.

We recognise that the information we collect is often of a highly sensitive nature and as an organisation we have adopted the highest privacy compliance standards relevant to ensure personal information is protected.

### Use & Disclosure
For administrative and billing purposes, and to enable the patient to be attended by other practitioners in our practice, ***Patient Information*** is shared between the practitioners who attend a patient.

**We may access information:**
- provided directly by the patient;
- provided on the patient’s behalf with the patient’s consent;
- from a health service provider who refers the patient to medical practitioners from health service providers to whom patients are referred.
- ***Patient Information*** collected by us may be used or disclosed:
- for the purpose the patient was advised of at the time of collection of the information by us;
- as required for delivery of the health service to the patient;
- as required for the ordinary operation of our services (i.e. to refer the patient to a medical specialist or other health service provider);
- as required under compulsion of law; or
- where there is a serious and imminent threat to an individual’s life, health, or safety; or a serious threat to public health or public safety.

Other than as described in this Policy or permitted under the National Privacy Act, Aspire Medical Centre uses its reasonable endeavours to ensure that identifying health information is not disclosed to any person.

We keep health information for a minimum of 7 years from the date of last entry in the patient record (unless the patient was a child in which case the record must be kept until the patient attains or would have attained 25 years of age). This is because we are required to maintain such records under some laws.

Because of the sensitive nature of the information collected by us to provide its services, extra precautions are taken to ensure the security of that information. Our electronic files are password-protected on several levels, and the patient database is encrypted.

We require all our employees and contractors to observe obligations of confidentiality in the course of their employment/contract. We require independent contractors to sign a confidentiality undertaking.

**Medical practitioners who provide services at our practices may refer patients to the following services:**
- pathology services;
- radiology services;
- public hospitals;
- private hospitals;
- day procedure centres;
- specialist medical practitioners and other health providers involved in the relevant patient’s care which may include surgeons, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, psychologists, dietitians, audiologists, podiatrists and the ambulance service.
